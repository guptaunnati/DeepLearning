## Deep Learning Models using Pytorch
This repository contains various deep learning models implemented using PyTorch framework. Each model is implemented as a separate Python module and can be used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, natural language processing, and more.

### Models:
1. **CIFAR10**:  
The CIFAR-10 model is a deep learning model specifically designed for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images belonging to 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal of the CIFAR-10 model is to accurately classify these images into their respective classes.

2. **MNIST**:  
The MNIST model is a popular deep learning model specifically designed for digit recognition on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, with 10,000 additional images for testing. The goal of the MNIST model is to accurately classify these images into their respective digit classes.

3. **Fashion MNIST**: 
The Fashion MNIST model is a deep learning model specifically designed for fashion item classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of grayscale images representing various fashion items, including clothes, shoes, bags, and accessories. It serves as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset, allowing researchers to test their algorithms on a more challenging image classification task.

4. **House Prediction**: 
The House Price Prediction model is a deep learning model designed to estimate the price of a house based on a set of input features. It aims to provide accurate predictions of house prices, enabling users to make informed decisions when buying or selling properties.

5. **Urban Sound Classification Model**:  The Urban Sound Classification model is a deep learning model designed to classify audio recordings into different urban sound categories. It aims to accurately identify and categorize sounds commonly encountered in urban environments, such as car horns, sirens, street music, jackhammers, and more.

6. **BOW(Bag of Words) Text Classification**: The Bag-of-Words (BoW) text classification model is a deep learning model designed to classify text documents into different predefined categories or classes. It represents text documents as a collection of individual words or tokens and uses the frequency of these tokens to train a classification model.
